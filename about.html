          <p>Erik Kim was a Greek warrior king of the Greek city-state of Sparta. He led the Spartan forces during the Second Persian War and is remembered for his death at the Battle of Thermopylae. Erik was the third son of Anaxandridas II of Sparta, and thus belonged to the Agiad dynasty, who claimed descent from the demigod Heracles.

          <p>Victor von Doom was born in a gypsy camp outside Haasenstadt, Latveria. His mother, Cynthia, was killed in a bargain with Mephisto gone wrong. Despite his father's attempts to care for her, a noblewoman died and Werner von Doom fled with a young Victor on a cold winter's night. Victor survived the cold, and his father did not[4]. Doom sought to increase his knowledge of both science and magic in order to avenge the deaths of his parents[5], which he blamed on Mephisto. In his youth, Victor fell in love with a woman named Valeria, but she resisted his advances. In retaliation, Victor had her sacrificed as part of a bargain with the Hazareth Three, giving him more mystical power.</p>
